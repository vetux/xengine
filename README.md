- [Foxtrot](https://github.com/vetux/foxtrot) - A 2D Platformer Game

## Building
### Supported Platforms
- Linux
  - Tested Compiler: GCC 10.2.1 64bit
- Windows 
  - Tested Compiler: MSVC 2022 64bit
    - Build warnings are emitted due to the fact that xng uses STL types in dllexport types. 
    - Users must ensure that their application is built with the same compiler version as the linked library because windows uses multiple STL dll files and allows loading of multiple STL version dlls into the same process. If the user links to a different STL version than the one used for building the engine dll there can be problems when passing types through the dll interface.

### Build Instructions
- Ensure that the include and library files of the external dependencies are available.
  - For linux: check ([install_dependencies.sh](install_dependencies.sh]))
  - For windows: download or build the driver dependencies and configure the paths to the built artifacts and include files in [config.cmake](cmake/config.cmake), Make sure that the names of the lib files match the selected driver library names in the cmake output.
- Clone the [imgui](submodules/imgui) submodule
- Load [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt) and build the engine target 

Eg. from the command line:
<code>mkdir mybuild/</code>
<code>cd mybuild/</code>
<code>cmake ../</code>
<code>cmake --build .</code>
